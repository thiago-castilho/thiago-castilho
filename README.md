## Hi there, I'm Thiago Castilho ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ I've got a degree in Computer Engineering. I'm going deeper into the world of software. For that, I started my postgraduate degree in Software Engineering. I'm passionate about technology, and I'm very thirsty for learning. In short, I'm a Software Quality Engineer with a bit of a developer's hand.
